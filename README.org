* Mstrings support for emacs
This is the basic indentation support for the beautiful Common Lisp
Mstrings library https://git.sr.ht/~shunter/mstrings in the Emacs lisp
mode.

Mstrings is nice-looking multiline string implementation. They usually started with the reader macro ~#M~

Code just adds correct behaviour when you press <TAB> inside Mstring.

* Example
#+begin_src lisp
(defun example (arg1 arg2)
  #M"This is docstring in
|Mstring format"
  ...)
#+end_src

Press TAB:

#+begin_src lisp
(defun example (arg1 arg2)
  #M"This is docstring in
     Mstring format"
  ...)
#+end_src

* P.S:
The code now works only with the Common Lisp, currently there is no
support for Mstrings in emacs-lisp itself.
